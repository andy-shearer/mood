# ChainLink Spring ‘22 Hackathon Project
## 🧠📔 Mental Health Check-In / Mood Diary NFT Platform
Conversation analysis to build a picture of users' mood over time. Chat service starts prompting regular conversation about mood, feelings, mental health etc with the user.
User can also reach out to the chat service to instigate a conversation.

During a period of regular conversation (eg. over the course of 2 weeks) the user’s responses are analysed by the platform through basic response classification eg. _“does the user sound positive or negative in their response?”_.

Chat service can ask additional things such as sharing a photo that you took recently that makes you happy. After a period of time, the platform will generate a unique dynamic NFT which is a summary of their mood over this period of time.

Includes analysis of mood over time, eg. _“your mood was consistently higher on Fridays!”_.

Includes pictures you’ve shared over this time, eg. _“this picture made you smile, you said you liked it because ‘......’”_.

User can continue chatting and get another NFT generated after 2 more weeks of regular chat (time interval is still to be decided).
